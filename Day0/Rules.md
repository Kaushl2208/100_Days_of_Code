#100DaysOfCode

##why do i want to do this?
###I really want to become a good developer and one thing i lack is consistency so i am making this open commitment that i will do this challenge not for 100 days BTW.

##what will be i doing during this period?
###Nothing fancy, let's see where it takes me.

##which language?
###This time i have decided to stick with c++.

##Why c++?
- *I love it's object oriented programming ability.*
- *And its simpler then C*



##What tools will be i using?

    -C++ 14
    - Terminal
    -Atom as my editors(No IDE's)

##My expectations
**at the end of this challenge i think i will be good enough to solve my day to day problems in python and also it will be a inspiration for me that finally I did something great in my semester
Last but not the least**

**I will be updating this time to time on regular basis and the one who wants to join this weird thing with me feel free to ping me, we all are begineers.**
